# Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions

![Advent of Code Logo](https://adventofcode.com/favicon.png)

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges implemented in Rust. Last year I got too busy to finish the whole calendar! Lets do it this year!

## Project Structure

The project follows a `bin` structure, where each day's solution is implemented as a separate binary. To run a specific day's solution, use the following command (same as last year):

```bash
cargo run --bin dayX
```

Replace `X` with the day number (e.g., `1`, `2`, ..., `25`).

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Running the Solutions

Navigate to the project directory and use the cargo command to run a specific day:

```bash
cargo run --bin dayX
```

## Project Organization

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for each day's solution.
- **`inputs/`**: Place the input files for each day in this directory.
